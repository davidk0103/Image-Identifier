# Image Classifier with Advanced Visualization

This project is an image classifier web application that uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images into one of ten classes from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The application provides advanced visualizations including confidence scores and an ROC curve for the classification result.

## Features

- Upload an image and get a prediction of its class.
- Visualize confidence scores for each class.
- Display an ROC curve for the classification result.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
- Matplotlib
- Flask-CORS

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
